## Hi everybody! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Van Khaiiii

I have a passion for **Computer Science**, with a deep focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Data Science**.
I'm currently engaged in cutting-edge projects that involve developing intelligent systems, analyzing large datasets, and creating 
models that understand and process human language. My expertise spans across **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **data analytics**, 
and the implementation of NLP algorithms to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data.

## Why have this blog?

> I want to create a place to store the knowledge I have learned and share it with others so that we can learn together and engage in discussions.

## Tech stack

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

This blog site takes inspiration from leohuynh.dev. I appreciate [Leo Huynh](https://twitter.com/hta218_) and [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for their contribution to this minimal, lightweight, and highly customizable blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="atom-symbol" /> Upgrading to **React 18**, **Next 13**.

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="party-popper" /> Adopting **Typescript**, committing with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="bar-chart" /> Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/) website analytics

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="eyes" /> Theming in dark mode with [Tokyonight Neovim Theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
  colors for better contrast.

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="man-technologist" /> My website refers to the design and code from the [lehuynh.dev](https://github.com/hta218/leohuynh.dev)
  repository and incorporates the tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog template, version 1.0.

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="inbox-tray" /> Bumping up `mdx-bundler`, `rehype`/`remark` plugins and dependencies to
  the latest version
